## Progress
I mostly worked on more data cleaning with information this week. I decided to try to join the IMDb dataset altogether to integrate some information regarding the movies such as runtime and ratings, in addition to how "popular" the movies were.

More importantly, I tried to convert the year into each of my tables for each individual dataset of movies. Since scraping from Wikipedia yielded the year as a row rather than a variable, I had to clean the data to make year a column. This took quite a bit of work - many of the years have inconsistent nominations and certain anomalies that threw off my numbers. However, I have been working to get the year information and all finished so that I can create a slider by year to show information about the internationalism of movies.
